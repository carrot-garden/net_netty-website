The Netty project team is proud to announce Netty 3.2.7.

The JAR file has been uploaded to JBoss.org Maven repository, and it's going to be propagated to the central repository soon.  You can also get the full tarball from [the download page](/downloads/).

For the detailed list of the changes, please refer to [the issue tracker page](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?milestone=1&state=closed).

Looking back, it was a very exciting iteration.  I granted push permission to various people who sent high-quality pull requests frequently, and I believe it leads us to faster yet open and sustainable development of the project.  I'd like to appreciate everyone involved into this effort for their faith on the project and myself.

If you didn't have a chance to [contribute](/community/), it's better late than never.  Actually, you can contribute a lot more than you think!
