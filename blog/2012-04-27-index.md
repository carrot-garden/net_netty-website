The Netty project team is proud to announce the final release of Netty 3.4.2. This is a bugfix-only release of the 3.4.x series.


The JAR file can be found on [Maven central repository](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|io.netty|netty|3.4.2.Final|bundle). You can also get the full tarball from [the download page](/downloads/).

This release includes an important change that allows to specify a maximum frame size for the [WebSocket Frame Decoders](http://netty.io/docs/stable/api/org/jboss/netty/handler/codec/http/websocketx/package-frame.html). This helps to prevent DOS attacks and should be used in all cases as it has security impacts.
See [#283](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/283) for more informations. Everyone who uses Netty WebSockets implementation should upgrade as soon as possible and change his code base to enforce a limit.

An other important improvement is the memory-usage optimization of the [ReplayingDecoder](http://netty.io/docs/stable/api/org/jboss/netty/handler/codec/replay/ReplayingDecoder.html) and [FrameDecoder](http://netty.io/docs/stable/api/org/jboss/netty/handler/codec/frame/FrameDecoder.html). This two Decoders are sub-classed by many other Decoders so chances are good that you can benefit from the changes. The used memory of each instance should be down to a minimum now. For more details checkout out [#280](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/280).

Beside this we had a handful of other bugfixes which are included.
For the detailed list of the changes, please refer to [the issue tracker page](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1&milestone=12).
