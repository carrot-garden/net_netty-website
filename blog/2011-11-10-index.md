Recently we announced our new web site at [http://netty.io/](http://netty.io/) but Red Hat have informed me that there are some outstanding issues related to the migration. As such we've been requested to move back to the original site at [http://jboss.org/netty/](http://jboss.org/netty/) until these have been addressed. I apologize for any confusion caused.

Hopefully we will be able to continue using StackOverflow and Google Groups as the Netty community agreed.
