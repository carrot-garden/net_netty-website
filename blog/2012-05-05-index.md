The Netty project team is proud to announce the final release of Netty 3.4.3. This is a bugfix release of the 3.4.x series


The JAR file can be found on [Maven central repository](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|io.netty|netty|3.4.3.Final|bundle). You can also get the full tarball from [the download page](/downloads/).

The most importent bugfix is the removal of a deadlock in ChunkedWriteHandler that could kick in sometimes. See [#297](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/297) for more details.
Beside this we also ship two small low-risk features which may be helpful for some users:
%ul
  %li ChannelLocal implements Iterable now. See [#307](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/307).
  %li SSLHandler allow to detect incoming close_notify messages via a ChannelFuture that get notified. See [#137](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/137)

Beside this we had a handful of other bugfixes which are included.
For the detailed list of the changes, please refer to [the issue tracker page](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1&milestone=13).
