The Netty project team is proud to announce Netty 3.3.1.

The JAR file is already on Maven central repository. You can also get the full tarball from [the download page](/downloads/).

This version introduces a couple exciting features. The most important one is [the new SPDY package](http://netty.io/docs/stable/api/org/jboss/netty/handler/codec/spdy/package-summary.html), which was contributed by Twitter.

If you develop for Android, you will be happy to hear that this release fix the incompability with Android (which was a regression introduced in 3.3.0). 

Beside this we introduced the possibility to @override the creation of the cumulative buffer in the FrameDecoder class. This allows you to adjust the way the buffer is created and so allows sub-classes to use way that fit them best. 

For the detailed list of the changes, please refer to [the issue tracker page](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?milestone=5&state=closed).

If you didn't have a chance to [contribute](/community/), you may to consider to do so in the future !
