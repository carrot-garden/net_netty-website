The Netty project team is proud to announce the final release of Netty 3.4.1. This is a bugfix release of the 3.4.x series.


The JAR file is already on [Maven central repository](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|io.netty|netty|3.4.1.Final|bundle). You can also get the full tarball from [the download page](/downloads/).

Netty 3.4.0.Final contains a regression which effects the ReplayDecoder and so any Decoder that is based on it (the most used is the HttpDecoder). Every user of Netty 3.4.0.Final should consider upgrading t0 3.4.1.Final as soon as possible.

This release also allows to disable the use of sun.misc.Unsafe to make it easier to run Netty in OSGI enviroments or Application Servers that ship some custom ClassLoader. To explicit disable the use of sun.misc.Unsafe just specify "org.jboss.netty.tryUnsafe=false" as System Property.

Netty 3.4.1 ships now with a workaround for a java bug (which is only fixed in java 7) that made it impossible to connect to link-local-addresses which contains a scope id / zone id. See [#267](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/267) for more details.

Beside this we had a handful of other bugfixes, most important in the Websocket handling (client-side).
For the detailed list of the changes, please refer to [the issue tracker page](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1&milestone=10).
