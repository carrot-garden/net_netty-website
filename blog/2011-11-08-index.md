As you might have noticed already, StackOverflow moderators decided to deprecate the 'netty' tag with the 'jboss-netty' tag and re-tagged all Netty questions with the new tag.  If you are going to post a new Netty question, please make sure to tag it with '[jboss-netty](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jboss-netty)', not 'netty'.
