The Netty project team is proud to announce Netty 3.3.0.

The JAR file is already being uploaded to the Maven central repository, and it's going to be propagated to the central repository soon.  You can also get the full tarball from [the download page](/downloads/).

This version introduces a couple exciting features.  The most important one is [the new websocketx package](http://netty.io/docs/stable/api/org/jboss/netty/handler/codec/http/websocketx/package-summary.html), which replaces the old websocket implementation.  As showcased in [our previous post](/blog/2011/11/17/), it provides a fully working WebSocket implementation that supports all known WebSocket specifications and passes [the Autobahn test suite](http://www.tavendo.de/autobahn/testsuite.html).

If you are interested in more flexible thread model in your pipeline, you might be interested in the improvements in the `org.jboss.netty.handler.execution` package.

At last but not least, `ChannelFuture` got a new method called `rethrowIfFailed()`.  You might find it useful when you have to handle a failure in your client application:

    
    ChannelFuture f = ...
    // Before:
    f.awaitUninterruptible();
    if (f.isFailure()) {
        throw new SomeException(f.getCause());
    }

    // After:
    f.awaitUninterruptibly().rethrowIfFailed();

I hope you like these new features - please feel free to leave comments on this post.  For the detailed list of the changes, please refer to [the issue tracker page](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?milestone=3&state=closed).

If you didn't have a chance to [contribute](/community/), it's better late than never.  Actually, you can contribute a lot more than you think!
